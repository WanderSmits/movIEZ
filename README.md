For this test I needed to make a homepage, categories page and a random page with vueJS and TS. 

On the homepage I wanted to show top rated/trending movies and my favorite movies.

When you click on a movie card, it directs you to a movie detail page, along with a trailer of the movie.

I also made a what to watch function which randomly fetches a movie on the random page.
